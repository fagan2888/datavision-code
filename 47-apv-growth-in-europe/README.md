# Alternatively Powered Vehicle growth in Europe

The raw data is available from the [European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA)](https://www.acea.be/),
as Excel files that are posted every quarter.

The relevant files are under the category [Alternative fuel vehicle registrations](https://www.acea.be/statistics/tag/category/electric-and-alternative-vehicle-registrations), which since 2018 has also included comparable figures for petrol and diesel cars.

For non-alternative fuel data, monthly figures were downloaded from https://www.acea.be/press-releases/archives/category/monthly-provisional-passenger-car-registrations. (However, the data from these files was not needed for the final visualization.)

The visualization was generated using _cars.R_.
