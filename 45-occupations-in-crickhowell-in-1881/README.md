# Occupations in Crickhowell in 1881

The data is from the 1881 Wales Census, which can be accessed via [Ancestry.co.uk], although an account is required.

The version of the data I used was lightly curated by Eliane Wigzell. She added a column for "Category of work",
and made some of the entries in the "Rank, Profession or Occupation" column more consistent and free of
unnecessary detail (the result is in a new "Occupation" column).

The visualization uses d3, but I used R to transform the input data into a tree representation (see `crick1881.R`).
